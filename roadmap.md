# Portfolio Roadmap — Website Developer / Freelancer

Purpose: a practical, phased plan to build a high-converting, modern portfolio that showcases skills (websites for gyms, restaurants, small businesses), advanced 3D/animation work, and converts visitors to clients.

---

## High-level goals
- Attract paying clients for web development and freelancing projects (gyms, restaurants, local businesses).
- Demonstrate technical depth: production React/Next.js sites, advanced animations, 3D interactive components.
- Convert via clear services, pricing starting points, case studies, and a frictionless contact flow.

## Target audience
- Small business owners (gyms, restaurants, boutiques). 
- Marketing managers for local businesses.
- Agencies looking for a freelance front-end/3D specialist.

## Quick contract (what this site must do)
- Inputs: visitor, project brief via contact form.
- Outputs: clear service offering, portfolio case studies, contact/quote funnel.
- Error modes: broken contact form, slow 3D models — provide graceful fallbacks.

## Recommended tech stack (primary)
- Core framework: Next.js with TypeScript (fast, SEO-friendly, good for Vercel). 
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (fast development) + custom CSS for polish.
- Animations: GSAP for timeline-based, polished UI animations.
- 3D & WebGL: three.js with React Three Fiber (R3F) + Drei helpers.
- Lightweight 3D authoring: Spline / Blender exports (GLTF) for hero scenes.
- Lottie for vector micro-animations (svg based) where appropriate.
- Media optimization: next/image (or imgix) + AVIF/WebP, lazy-loading.
- Forms & backend: serverless functions (Vercel/Netlify) or Formspree/EmailJS; optionally Supabase for simple DB.
- Headless CMS: Sanity / Contentful / Strapi (for editable case studies and blog).
- Deployment: Vercel (recommended) or Netlify.
- CI / CD: GitHub Actions (lint/test/build on push).
- Analytics: Google Analytics + Hotjar / Plausible for session insights.

## Optional / advanced tools
- Framer Motion for page transitions when not using GSAP everywhere.
- Tailwind Typography plugin and Headless UI for accessible components.
- Playwright for E2E tests.
- Storybook for isolated component demos.
- Webpack/Bundling: rely on Next.js build by default.

## UX & Conversion priorities
1. Hero: short value statement + prominent CTA (Get a Quote). 3D or subtle parallax background.
2. Services: clear cards (e.g., Restaurants, Gyms, E-commerce, Corporate), each with outcome-focused bullets.
3. Pricing guide / starting points: small ranges or packages to pre-qualify leads.
4. Case studies: show problem → solution → impact (with images, live demo links, tech used, client quote).
5. Process & trust: workflow, testimonials, logos, and client outcomes.
6. Contact/Quote flow: short form + calendar link; optionally a questionnaire to pre-qualify.
7. Footer: social, email, developer signature, minimal site map.

## Features & polish (MVP → v2)
MVP (launchable within ~1–2 weeks if working focused):
- Home (hero, services, highlight project, CTA)
- About (short bio and skills)
- Projects (3–6 case studies with images + links)
- Contact form (serverless or 3rd-party) + Calendly link
- Responsive, accessible layout + SEO meta

v1.1 (polish, 1–2 weeks):
- 3D hero (R3F) or animated SVG fallback
- GSAP entrance animations and scroll-triggered reveals
- Light CMS integration for projects
- Basic analytics

v2 (ongoing):
- Interactive case studies (playable prototypes / before/after sliders)
- Full-screen immersive 3D demo (opt-in for high-end devices)
- Multi-language support if needed
- Blog & marketing pages

## Architecture & file structure (suggested)
- / (Next.js) 
  - /components (atomic components, include 3D components in /components/three)
  - /pages (index.tsx, projects, about, contact)
  - /lib (api helpers, form handlers)
  - /public (images, GLTFs, Lottie JSON)
  - /styles (global + tailwind)

## Performance & accessibility rules
- Lighthouse performance target: >90 (mobile ≥ 75 early on).
- Keep 3D models small (prefer LODs, compressed GLTF). Provide 2D fallback images for low-power devices.
- Defer heavy scripts; use intersection-observer to load 3D only when visible.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard focus states, color contrast, aria labels on interactive 3D controls.

## Testing & quality gates
- Unit tests for utility functions (Jest + Testing Library).
- Visual / E2E: Playwright tests for contact flow and project pages.
- Automated linting: ESLint + Prettier.
- CI: GitHub Actions to run lint/test/build on PR.

## Asset & content checklist (prep before build)
- High-quality screenshots of completed projects (desktop + mobile)
- Short 2–3 sentence case study summaries (problem, tech, result)
- A professional headshot and short bio
- Pricing or service packages copy
- Testimonials or references (even short quotes)
- Icons / logos for service categories
- GLTF models or Spline exports (optimized)

## SEO & marketing action items
- Title / meta descriptions per page, OG images (use dynamic OG images via Vercel OG or static images)
- Google Business listing and local SEO (if targeting local businesses)
- Newsletter sign-up or lead magnet (optional)

## Security & privacy
- GDPR-compliant contact form (consent checkbox) where applicable.
- Avoid storing sensitive client data unless necessary; if storing, use Supabase or a simple DB with env secrets.
- Add a privacy policy page.

## Service pages & redirect strategy
- Portfolio will host compact service landing pages at `/services/<slug>` (e.g. `/services/gym`, `/services/restaurant`) that sell the outcome, show screenshots, and include a clear CTA to "View demo" or "Get a quote".
- Full site demos will live either as internal demo routes (`/demos/<slug>`) for lightweight prototypes or as external/live URLs (subdomains or client domains). The portfolio will link to these with analytics tracking.
- Implementation notes:
  - Next.js: use `pages/services/[slug].tsx` with SSG (getStaticPaths/getStaticProps) for each service.
  - Use `pages/demos/[slug].tsx` for full demos; lazy-load heavy assets and 3D here.
  - Provide a 2D fallback image and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.
  - Track demo clicks in analytics and use UTMs for outreach follow-up.

## Service page template (required sections)
- Hero: short outcome headline + CTA (Get a quote / View demo)
- Outcomes: 3–5 customer-focused bullets
- Gallery: screenshots / before-after / video
- Features & tech stack
- Pricing starter or packages
- Demo link (internal or external)
- Contact CTA + short qualifying form
- Testimonial / trust element

## Launch checklist
- [ ] All core pages complete (Home, Projects, About, Contact)
- [ ] Contact form verified (test emails received)
- [ ] Lighthouse scores checked and acceptable
- [ ] Analytics installed & working
- [ ] CI passing and automatic deploy configured
- [ ] Backups of any CMS content

## Roadmap timeline (example)
- Week 0: Content gathering & wireframes (2–3 days)
- Week 1: Build MVP pages + styles + content (5 days)
- Week 2: Add 3D hero + GSAP polish + responsive tweaks (3–5 days)
- Week 3: CMS hookup, tests, CI, and deploy (3–5 days)
- Week 4: Marketing polish, analytics, and outreach templates

## Small contract: how I’ll measure success
- 3–5 inbound qualified leads in first 90 days
- Bounce rate reduced on project pages (<50%)
- 1+ paid client attributable to the portfolio within 90 days (goal)

## Learning & resource checklist (to study as you build)
- React Three Fiber (R3F) + Drei examples
- GSAP ScrollTrigger and animation timelines
- GLTF model optimization and Draco compression
- Next.js image optimization and dynamic OG images
- Accessibility basics (WCAG)

## Actionable next steps for me (developer tasks)
- [ ] Choose stack & scaffold project (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- [ ] Prepare content and case study copy
- [ ] Build MVP pages and wire up contact form
- [ ] Add one demo 3D hero (GLTF via R3F) with a 2D fallback
- [ ] Implement GSAP animations across key sections
- [ ] Add CMS and deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Run Lighthouse, fix performance regressions


```markdown

- [ ] Step 3: Add case studies and project assets
- [ ] Step 4: Implement 3D hero using R3F + optimized GLTF
- [ ] Step 5: Add GSAP scroll and entrance animations
- [ ] Step 6: Hook contact form (serverless) + Calendly
- [ ] Step 7: Setup CI (GitHub Actions) and deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Step 8: Add tests (Playwright) and monitoring
```

If you want, I can now scaffold a Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind starter in this folder and add a sample 3D hero component with R3F + a GSAP demo animation — tell me to proceed and I will scaffold it next.
